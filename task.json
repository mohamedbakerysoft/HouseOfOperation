Fixed Git ownership issues and merge conflicts in deployment script with safe.directory configuration, proper chown commands, git stash for local changes, and hard reset before pulling. Fine-tuned CEO image size: 600px max-width with 400px minimum height for perfect balance, 85% width on mobile, 1.8fr grid column allocation, 3:4 aspect ratio. Removed separate title section and integrated CEO caption directly on image with always-visible overlay: enhanced text styling (2.5rem name, 1.2rem position in gold), improved shadow effects, responsive mobile sizing (2rem/1rem)."
